Title: Raw Material Management

Description:

It is a Project that is done in both HTML and JavaScript. It is a Form where the entered details are stored in the "JsonPowerDB" Database. A peculiar feature about this project is the buttons used in the form. The Form has 9 Buttons namely 'New', 'Save', 'Edit', 'Change', 'Reset', 'First', 'Previous', 'Next', 'Last'. The 'New' and 'Edit' buttons are enabled at default, while all the other buttons are disabled. If a new record needs to be inserted, the 'New' button needs to be pushed, if an already existing data needs to be updated, the 'Edit' button needs to be pushed. The 'Save' button is enabled when 'New' button is pushed and the 'Change' button is enabled when the 'Edit' button is pushed to submit changes in both the scenarios. the buttons namely , 'First', 'Previous', 'Next', 'Last' are used to naviagte through records in the database. The 'First' button and 'Previous' button is enabled at default and when during Navigation and it works as such.

There 4 such Pages named for the above functions named "Item Inventory Management" , "Inward Page" , "Outward Page" , "Item Report Page" ( where Item report Page only navigates through the records.

There is a Video Demonstration for the project

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB: Using JsonPowerDB (JPDB) in the above project offers several advantages, including its schema-free nature, which allows flexibility in storing student data without predefined structures. The built-in REST APIs simplify database interactions, making it easy to connect your frontend directly to the database with minimal code. This enables quick operations like inserting, updating, or retrieving student records in real-time with high performance.

Additionally, JPDB provides primary key support, ensuring unique identification of records, and works seamlessly with JSON, reducing the need for data transformation. Its low setup requirements, security through connection tokens, and scalability make it an ideal choice for lightweight applications, offering both speed and convenience for real-time data management.
